## Building Documentation

The Documentation is located in doc/ in markdown format.

You can run "make doc" to generate the merged documentation in HTML and
markdown. This will generate the documentation in merged markdown and merged
HTML format.

This requires the `cmark` markdown converter to be installed and callable.

The merged output files will be in `doc/merged.md` and `doc/merged.html`.

This repository might contain a `doc/merged.md` and `doc/merged.html` for
convenience, but this might be out of date at times.
